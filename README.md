# bootcamp-final-project-ParksRoadTripPlanner

Minor issues: 
-Some components are pretty clean while other's... well I hope you like spaghetti.... i can eventually makes these big components smaller. 
-Google Map rezooming when adding/removing waypoints is a little annoying... would like to set a condition so it doesn't happen with waypoints.
